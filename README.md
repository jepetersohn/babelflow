## Summary
DBC Phase 2 project completed over 4 days. We were assigned to create a Sinatra application from the ground up: a clone with the functionality of [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com), with a unique theme invented by us. Our group created Babelflow, in which users are encouraged to post thematically proper responses to questions/comments in a different language than the original post. For example: A user may post a question in Spanish asking about fun places to visit in Chicago; responders are encouraged to reply to that question in any language <i>other than</i> Spanish. 

### Assignment Requirement per DBC
- Users can post questions.  Other users can answer them.
- Users can comment on both questions and answers.  Like StackOverflow, the comments should just be displayed in a flat list.
- The user who posted a question can declare one of the user-submitted answers to be the best answer.
- Users can upvote and downvote questions, answers, and commentsâ€”only one vote per user for each question, answer, and comment.
- Users cannot add a question, answer, or comment or vote unless they're logged in, but they can view all of the above when logged out.
