## Summary
DBC project completed over 4 days. We were assigned to create a substantial Sinatra application from the ground up: a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) clone, with a unique theme. Our group created Babelflow, in which users are encouraged to post thematically proper responses to questions/comments in a different language than the original post.

### Assignment Requirement per DBC
- Users can post questions.  Other users can answer them.
- Users can comment on both questions and answers.  Like StackOverflow, the comments should just be displayed in a flat list.
- The user who posted a question can declare one of the user-submitted answers to be the best answer.
- Users can upvote and downvote questions, answers, and commentsâ€”only one vote per user for each question, answer, and comment.
- Users cannot add a question, answer, or comment or vote unless they're logged in, but they can view all of the above when logged out.
